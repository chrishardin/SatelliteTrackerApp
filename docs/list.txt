1. Setup Your Flutter Project:
Create a new Flutter project in your IDE.
Set up your directory structure for screens, widgets, services, and models.
2. Design the UI:
Begin with the main.dart file to set up your MaterialApp and the initial route.
3. Implement the Welcome Screen:
Use a Scaffold widget to set up the basic structure.
Add an AppBar for the top bar, if needed.
Use a Column or ListView widget to layout the text and buttons.
For buttons like "Log in", "Join now", and "Continue as a guest", use ElevatedButton or FlatButton widgets.
Implement navigation to the login page when the "Log in" or "Join now" button is tapped.
4. Implement the Login Screen:
Again, use a Scaffold widget.
For input fields, use TextFormField widgets wrapped in a Form widget to handle user input.
Implement form validation to check the user input for email and password.
Use ElevatedButton for the "Sign In" button and set up onPressed callbacks for authentication logic.
Add social media sign-in options using packages like flutter_signin_button.
5. Set Up Firebase:
Integrate Firebase into your Flutter project by following the official documentation.
Use Firebase Auth to manage user authentication based on the inputs from your login form.
6. Handle User Authentication:
Write the logic for signing in users with email and password using Firebase Auth.
Use Firebase Auth to handle OAuth flows for "Facebook" and "Google" sign-in methods.
7. Implement Navigation:
Set up named routes in your MaterialApp configuration.
Use Navigator.pushNamed to navigate to different screens upon successful login or registration.
8. Work on State Management:
Decide on a state management approach (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, etc.).
Implement the necessary providers or blocs to manage the state of your UI based on user authentication status.
9. Finalize the UI:
Once the functionality is in place, focus on the aesthetics, aligning your Flutter widgets with the design language of the wireframes.
Use themes to ensure consistent styling of text and buttons throughout the app.
10. Test Your App:
Write widget tests to ensure each part of your UI works as expected.
Conduct manual testing to ensure the flow matches the user experience outlined in the wireframes.
